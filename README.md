# Role-Playing-Game

This repo includes two files, RPG-Class-Creation and Play-RPG

RPG-Class-Creation has two classes, Hero and Enemy, that inherit
from the character superclass. This is what will be used to play
the game. 
The driver code includes a short domonstration of how the methods 
can be used to play the game.

Play-RPG imports the RPG-Class-Creation methods to allow for the 
use of the Enemy and Hero classes.
